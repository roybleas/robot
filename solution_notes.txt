I tried two approaches:

1) The toyrobot class which is a quick hack with hard coded table size and a single class
2) The robot class which can be configured to have a different size table, including rectangular.
   It could easily be extended to for example : 
   		have obstacles on the map to avoid;
   		new instructions like turn around on encountering a table edge;
   		turn 45º instead of 90º.
